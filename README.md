# credit_card_approval_r_project

This is a course empirical project:

To minimize loss from the credit card companies, they needs a decision rule regarding who to give approval of the credit card application and who not to. An applicants demographic and socio-economic profiles are considered by credit card companies before a decision is taken regarding his/her application. This empirical project gives you the opportunity to implement various statistical learning methods discussed in the class on a credit card approval dataset. After you run the analysis in R, write a report of 2500 words (together with plots, important statistics) summarizing your finding. Your report should be no more than 20 pages.

The Credit Approval dataset is available in the archives of machine learning repository of University of California, Irvine (http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/credit+approval). It consists of 690 rows , repre- senting 690 individuals applying for a credit card, and 16 variables in total. The first 15 variables represent various attributes of the individual like gender, age, marital status, years employed etc. The 16th variable is the one of interest: credit approved(or just approved). It contains the outcome of the application, either positive(represented by +) meaning approved or negative (represented by -) meaning rejected. 

Keep in mind that you may need to preprocess the data (for example, data cleaning, data integration, data transformation , data reduction, missing values imputation among other tasks), carry out exploratory data analysis, and then build various models to fit the training data, compute the test error and explain the results. Finally pick the best model in terms of lowest test error and try to justify your choice of model.

Note: The project was completed in Dec 2019.
